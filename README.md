# Learn SASS

Teach yourself the basics of SASS and SCSS through simple coding exercises. Based on the node workshopper adventure format popularized by [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io).

This adventure utilizes tutorials from the awesome [Sass guide](http://sass-lang.com/guide).

## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org/download](http://nodejs.org/download)

### Install `learn-sass` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```bash
npm install -g learn-sass
```

The `-g` or `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```bash
sudo npm install -g learn-sass
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Have a look at the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
learn-sass
```

You'll see the menu:
